The assignment has been configured using CMake.  To generate the project simply execute CMake on the HW1 directory. It is recommended that you create a build directory to generate the solution or makefiles in order to keep the source code cleaner.

Pre-requisites include Qt 4.6.2 or higher and CMake 2.6 or higher.  The University servers have all these installed already.

      On Linux, a build may be done by:
      $> cd Query-Dependent
      $> mkdir build
      $> cd build
      $> cmake ../
      $> make
      $> ./src/Visualization/Visualization

   On Windows, or with the GUI version of CMake on any platform, perform the following:
   1.)    Where is the source code: <path-to-Query-Dependent>/Query-Dependent
   2.) Where to build the binaries: <path-to-Query-Dependent>/Query-Dependent/build
   3.) Click the Configure button
   4.) Click the Generate button
